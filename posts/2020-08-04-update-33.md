## Pruned mode

You can now run your base node in pruned mode. Pruned mode is an important feature of Mimblewimble that significantly
reduces the size required to store the block chain by removing spent transactions.

The feature is still experimental and there's still work to be done, but if you want to test it so long, you'll need to
run the latest source and update your config.

More instructions are in the repo.

## Merge mining

There were some more contributions to merge mining and the stand alone wallet

## Other

[@sdbondi](https://github.com/sdbondi) proposed implementing a more bounded and structured approach to protocols on
  the Tari p2p network in order to make development and testing easier.
