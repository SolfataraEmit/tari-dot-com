Something a little different this week. While development effort has been focused on planning and implementation of 
the [digital asset layer], the Tari development community has been thinking about some interesting use-cases for 
e2e-encrypted messaging routed on the Tari DHT network. 

The _raison d'Ãªtre_ of the network routing/messaging feature is to allow wallets to complete _Mimblewimble_ transactions
without requiring both participants to be online at the same time. To briefly explain how this works, a wallet broadcasts 
some encrypted payload to the network addressed to some other network address. That message is routed within the Tari
network until either the destination is reached or, failing that, is kept by neighbours and handed over when destination 
wallet comes online.

That's all pretty nifty, but can this only be used for sending _Mimblewimble_ transactions? As you may have guessed, the 
answer to that is no. In fact, the routing and storing nodes can't really tell the difference between transaction messages 
and any other message sent on the network. This "store-and-forward" functionality, allows a number of interesting use-cases 
normally reserved for centralized servers.

## Checkmate!

As an experiment, one of the development contributors decided to implement a toy multiplayer chess game in Rust 
where the game participants never directly connect to each other -- all communication is routed through the Tari network.
If your opponent is offline, they will receive your move when they are next online.
