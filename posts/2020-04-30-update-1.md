Firstly, the response to the testnet launch has been amazing. I woke up to over 400 messages on telegram ðŸš’

Weâ€™re still processing the deluge of feedback, but I can give an update on the dev communityâ€™s priorities for the next 24-48 hours based on what weâ€™ve read so far:

### Network partition issues. 

Weâ€™ve identified one issue thatâ€™s causing the bulk of the network partition issues: The windows node binary we released at launch has a bug that prevents it from talking to other (non-window) nodes. (Almost everyone develops on a Mac or Linux, so we missed this). Weâ€™ll be releasing a windows binary update in the next 12 hours that will fix this particular issue.

There are other network and Tor issues as well, which weâ€™re continuing to investigate.

### Documentation

There are lots of questions on node installation, particularly on Windows, so weâ€™ll be updating the docs based on the feedback weâ€™ve received.

### Stuck and pending transactions in the app

These are almost all related to the networking issues discussed above, but weâ€™re considering  additional improvements to  the app in upcoming releases, such as:
* automatic resending of transactions, 
* canceling stuck txs (in CLI wallet currently)

### Emoji Ids

Generally, the Emoji Id concept has been well received, but weâ€™re hearing that Copy & pasting can be inconsistent. It seems like some apps convert emoji into images which breaks emoji id sharing. Weâ€™re looking into ways to make Emoji ID sharing robust. In the meantime, the QR code is a reliable means of getting your Tari address into peopleâ€™s phones.
