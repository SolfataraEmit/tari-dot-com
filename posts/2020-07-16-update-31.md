Here's one for the tech nerds.

Tari core protocol contributor,
[@sdbondi](https://github.com/sdbondi) has written
[Part I](https://www.tari.com/lessons/06_tari_comms_i.html) of a deep dive into the Tari P2P messaging system.

This tutorial covers the transports that are used, how a peer connection is built and maintained, how Tor integration
works, what the Tari messaging protocol looks like, and how to build a communications stack.

Even if you aren't super technical, give this lesson a quick read; it will give you an sense of what goes into
building a completely private, peer-to-peer network on the internet.
