## Tari Merge Mining Pool 

Early support for Tari Merge Mining has been added to the [Tari fork of nodejs-pool](https://github.com/tari-project/nodejs-pool).

If you are adventurous and would like to run your own merge mining pool on your local machine, or deploy it on a public server you can
find some basic instructions to get you started in the [README.md](https://github.com/tari-project/nodejs-pool/blob/tari/README.md#tari-merge-mining).

If one or two evenings of devops doesn't appeal to you, we'll be making our deployment of nodejs-pool available for anyone to use in 
the coming days. You'll be able to connect your miner (typically xmrig) to the pool. Just provide concatenated (tari:monero) wallet
addresses and earn both testnet coins. 

For example, if your _Tari_ address is `c6037038cce673cf1c1e26e7b7609ffbbba297eae4caf3ce7123a949c7af0162` and your _monero_ address is `581EfC8NL2yLZyavVrY2dGZNsqBzzcU5yE8iLrFwPLkQHxUckaWy8vjeLntrynGoBwLeKTBdgJ2rR66ZiqKogkhpS8DAMR3`
your xmrig config will be as follows: 
```json
{
  "url": "address-to-pool.com:5555",
  "user": "c6037038cce673cf1c1e26e7b7609ffbbba297eae4caf3ce7123a949c7af0162:581EfC8NL2yLZyavVrY2dGZNsqBzzcU5yE8iLrFwPLkQHxUckaWy8vjeLntrynGoBwLeKTBdgJ2rR66ZiqKogkhpS8DAMR3",
  "pass": "miner-mcgee:mmg1999@gmail.com",
  "coin": "monero",
  "enabled": true
}
```

We're excited to for the community to try this out!
