## Layer 2 Progress

The Tari development community is hard at work on the Layer 2 [DAN], and this week we take a look at the Covenants RFC and quality of life improvements in the Tari mobile wallet [Aurora].

### Covenants RFC

Previously we posted [the draft] for covenants on Tari. After some discussion, [RFC-0250 Covenants] was published for community feedback.

Let's take a quick look at the proposal. Covenants allow the spender of a transaction output ([UTXO]) to place restrictions on how that output can subsequently be spent.

Wait - that sounds like [TariScript]? Not exactly - the script on a UTXO only restricts how it may be _spent in a transaction_. Once it is spent, the resulting output has no such restriction. That is the functionality covenants aim to provide.

The proposed implementation will add a `covenant` field to each transaction input and output. Each covenant is composed of [set operations], filtering the output set using a discreet set of rules. If at least one output in the set is matched by the filtering rules, the covenant is upheld and the output can be included in a new transaction and block.

Normal transactions will have the identity (ie. empty) covenant - meaning that no restriction is applied.

An [NFT] royalty covenant would have to ensure a few things:

- that the features that define the output are preserved (its unique id and metadata)
- that the [TariScript] of the output is preserved (scripting a royalty payment)
- and that the covenant itself is preserved (ensuring royalties on subsequent transfers)

This does lead to protocol and consensus changes - the covenant must be committed to in the output hash to prevent [malleability], and must be validated when entering the mempool and before being included in the blockchain.

More information on the proposed set operation functions and other examples are available [in the RFC].

If you have any feedback, please come discuss the Covenants RFC with us on IRC in `#tari-dev` on [Libera.Chat], our [Discord server], or [Telegram].

### Aurora Mobile Wallet

Upcoming version `0.9` of the reference Tari mobile wallet includes a lovely new user experience when entering seed words for recovery.

Since these words are part of [predefined lists], it makes sense to assist the user by filtering words as letters are typed.

That means a lot less typing! 2 to 4 letters are enough to find your word and tap the suggestion ðŸ˜Ž

See it in action in this video:

## Happy Thanksgiving ðŸ¦ƒ

We'd like to wish everyone a very happy Thanksgiving. We are incredibly grateful for our community. May you be safe and blessed with your family and friends.
