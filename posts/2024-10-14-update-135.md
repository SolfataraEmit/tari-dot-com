Welcome to the next Tari update. Tari Universe, much like its namesake, continues to expand at an astronomical rate, and we have you to thank for it. We’d like to share some stats regarding the known Universe:

* The [Tari Universe waitlist](https://universe.tari.com/) is now sitting at over 260,000 sign-ups.
* There are over 16,000 downloads of Tari Universe.
* On average, each Tari Universe user's sent invites has resulted in four of their invited friends installing Tari Universe and enrolling in the incentivized testnet.

Interest in Universe has also been driving parties to the underlying [Tari protocol and base apps](https://github.com/tari-project/tari), and as a result, the combined mining on our testnet has reached over 800GH/s for our SHA3x GPU hash rate - an almost 6500% increase from where we were at the start of last week.

We’ve also learned some hard lessons as Tari is now being stress-tested in the only way that truly matters: in the wild and the hands of users. Reliability of the installation and updating process, general network connectivity, network fragmentation, and the ability to recover from some common user errors have all reared their head, and contributors are working hard to conquer these demons as quickly as possible. Thank you to everyone in the Tari community for your patience and detailed feedback. Together, we will make Universe the most beautiful and easiest-to-use crypto product in the world.

### New Tari Universe Developments
The community has been working tirelessly in the commit mines, and their efforts have translated into some great new features and stability fixes:
* Like our Mac and Linux versions, Tor is now enabled by default on Tari Universe for Windows users. This has helped resolve many network connectivity issues that impacted users’ experience with Tari Universe in the past week. You can [find out more about Tor here.](https://tlu.tarilabs.com/protocols/intro-to-tor-and-i2p#tor-network)
* [We’ve added CDN mirrors for the dependencies](https://github.com/tari-project/universe/pull/658) downloaded when installing and subsequently updating Universe and some additional automated downloads of unique dependencies in different environments. This ensures better reliability both when installing Universe for the first time and when keeping it up-to-date.
* There have been various graphical improvements and user enhancements to the experience of winning blocks, [earning gems](https://github.com/tari-project/universe/pull/682), and [tracking your reward history](https://github.com/tari-project/universe/pull/723).
* We’d like to give a shoutout to our community members who have recently contributed German and French localizations: [W666lker (German)](https://github.com/tari-project/universe/pull/802) and [firebomb (French)](https://github.com/tari-project/universe/pull/717). Thank you for helping us make Tari Universe even better.

## Minotari - Base Layer
### Unofficial Ledger Wallet Now Available
While it’s been includes in previous releases for a while, we wanted to highlight that there is now a Tari native [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) wallet app for the Nano S Plus included with our [Minotari releases](https://github.com/tari-project/tari/releases), which can be manually side-loaded on the Nano S Plus. In addition, this week we’ve added support for the Stax and Flex devices, although the app currently has to be built from source and has some known issues contributors are working on resolving. If you want to learn more about Tari Ledger support, you can head over and [check the readme for the project](https://github.com/tari-project/tari/tree/development/applications/minotari_ledger_wallet/wallet).
