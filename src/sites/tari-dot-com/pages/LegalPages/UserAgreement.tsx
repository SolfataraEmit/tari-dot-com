                                    The Wallet is provided to you exclusively by the Tari Network and/or Tari Testnet.
                                    The Wallet is only capable of supporting XTM. Under no circumstances should you
                                    attempt to store virtual currencies in your Wallet that the Wallet does not support.
                                </p>
                            </li>

                                    When you create a Wallet, the Wallet software generates a cryptographic private and
                                    public key pair that you may use to send and receive any XTM via the Tari Network.
                                    YOU MUST STORE, OUTSIDE OF THE SERVICES, A BACKUP OF ALL WALLET CREDENTIALS,
                                    INCLUDING YOUR EMOJI ID, PASSPHRASES, IDENTIFIERS, BACKUP PHRASES, PRIVATE KEYS AND
                                    NETWORK ADDRESSES. If you do not maintain a backup of your Wallet data outside of
                                    the Services, you will not be able to access XTM previously accessed using your
                                    Wallet in the event that we discontinue or no longer offer some or all of the
                                    Services or may otherwise lose access to XTM. We are not responsible for maintaining
                                    this data on your behalf.
                                </p>

                                Your Wallet will generally be made available on a non-custodial basis enabling you to

                                    As the owner of XTM in your Wallet, you shall bear all risk of loss of such XTM.
                                    Tari Labs shall not have any liability for fluctuations in the fiat currency value
                                    of XTM held in your Wallet.

                                    You control the XTM held in your Wallet. At any time, subject to outages, downtime,
                                    and other applicable policies, you may withdraw your XTM by sending it to a
                                    different blockchain address controlled by you or a third party. In the event you
                                    wish to transfer XTM into the Wallet, you may be prompted to set up a backup phrase
                                    in order to do so.

                                        There is no purchase necessary to receive XTM in an Airdrop. However, you must

                                        An offer to receive XTM in an Airdrop is only available to you while supplies

                <p>
                    You may not be eligible to receive XTM from an Airdrop in your jurisdiction. In the event that you
                    have multiple Wallets with Tari Labs, you are only eligible to receive XTM from an Airdrop in one
                    Wallet and for one user.

                                Tari Testnet subject to the Airdrop. You may not rely on any of our statements

                <h2>GENERAL RISK FACTORS</h2>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Your use of the Services requires you to bear risks for which we cannot be held responsible. We
                        list some, but not all of these risks below:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        a) Hardware, software or connections required to interact with the Tari Network and/or Tari
                        Testnet might fail, succumb to malware, unauthorized access or malicious attacks. Third parties
                        may obtain unauthorized access to the Services, including, but not limited to your public and
                        private keys. Tari Labs shall not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions,
                        errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Services, however caused.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        b) Forks, unknown vulnerabilities in or unanticipated changes to the network protocol may cause
                        losses to you or others. Tari Labs has no control over the Tari Network and/or Tari Testnet and
                        shall not be responsible for any harm occurring as a result of the inability to reverse a
                        transaction, and any losses in connection therewith due to erroneous or fraudulent actions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        c) The risk of loss of value in using Services involving XTM and/or tXTM may be substantial and
                        losses may occur over a short period of time. In addition, price and liquidity are subject to
                        significant fluctuations that may be unpredictable.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        d) XTM and tXTM are not legal tender and are not backed by any sovereign government. In
                        addition, the legislative and regulatory landscape around virtual currencies such asXTM and tXTM
                        is constantly changing and may affect your ability to use or transfer XTM and/or tXTM.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        e) XTM and tXTM transactions may not be reversible. Once you send XTM and/or tXTM to an address,
                        you may lose access to your XTM and/or tXTM temporarily or indefinitely. For example, an address
                        may have been entered incorrectly, or an address may belong to an entity that will not return
                        your XTM and/or tXTM. XTM and/or tXTM mistakenly sent to an address we control may not be
                        recoverable.

                                of business in the United States), any dispute arising between you and us under this
                                User Agreement or our relationship (whether arising out of contract, tort, statute or
                                any other manner) shall be settled in binding arbitration, in accordance with the
                                Federal Arbitration Act under the American Arbitration Association's rules; provided,
                                however, nothing in this Agreement will waive, preclude or otherwise limit your right to
                                (i) bring an individual action in a US small claims court or (ii) file a representative
                                action solely to obtain a public injunction.

                            <p>
                                The arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and shall take place
                                in the county or parish of your billing address, or another mutually agreeable location,
                                in the English language. The arbitrator shall apply the law of the state of Tennessee,
                                without regard to its conflict of laws principles. The arbitrator may award any relief
                                that a court of competent jurisdiction could award, including attorneys' fees when
                                authorized by law, and the arbitration decision may be enforced in any court.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                You agree that the arbitrator shall have the authority to order relief, and you agree to
                                abide by all decisions and awards rendered in such a proceeding, which shall be final
                                and conclusive. At your request, hearings may be conducted in person or by telephone and
                                the arbitrator may provide for submitting and determining motions on briefs, without
                                oral hearings. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this
                                agreement shall be entitled to reasonable costs and attorneys' fees. If the
                                arbitrator(s) or administrator imposes filing fees or other administrative costs on you,
                                we will reimburse you, upon request, to the extent such fees or costs would exceed those
                                that you would otherwise have to pay if you were proceeding instead in a court. If a
                                court decides that any provision of this section concerning Arbitration is invalid or
                                unenforceable, that provision shall be severed and resolved in accordance with Tennessee
                                law exclusively and the other parts of this section concerning Arbitration shall still
                                apply. In no case shall the remainder of this User Agreement be affected. If the
                                invalidity or unenforceability of a provision causes a dispute to proceed in a court
                                instead of arbitration, the Parties agree that such court must be located in Nashville,
                                Tennessee, applying Tennessee law.
