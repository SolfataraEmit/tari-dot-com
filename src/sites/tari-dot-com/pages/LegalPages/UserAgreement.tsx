                <h3>6.2. Your Wallet</h3>

                <p>
                    Your Wallet will generally be made available on a non-custodial basis enabling you to self-custody
                    your XTM. Among other things, this means that:
                </p>

                <p>
                    6.2.1. As the owner of XTM in your Wallet, you shall bear all risk of loss of such XTM. Tari Labs
                    shall not have any liability for fluctuations in the fiat currency value of XTM held in your Wallet.
                </p>

                <p>
                    6.2.2. You control the XTM held in your Wallet. At any time, subject to outages, downtime, and other
                    applicable policies, you may withdraw your XTM by sending it to a different blockchain address
                    controlled by you or a third party. In the event you wish to transfer XTM into the Wallet, you may
                    be prompted to set up a backup phrase in order to do so.
                </p>

                <h3>6.3. Risk Disclosures Relating to Your Wallet</h3>

                <p>
                    6.3.1. In order to be completed, any XTM or tXTM transaction created with the Wallet must be
                    confirmed and recorded in the XTM ledger associated with the Tari Network and/or Tari Testnet. The
                    Tari Network and Tari Testnet are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks supported by independent
                    third parties, which are not owned, controlled or operated by Tari Labs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    6.3.2. Tari Labs has no control over the Tari Network and therefore cannot and does not ensure that
                    any transaction details you submit via our Services will be confirmed on the Tari Network. The
                    transaction details you submit via our Services may not be completed, or may be substantially
                    delayed, by the Tari Network. We do not guarantee that the Wallet can transfer title or right in XTM
                    or make any warranties whatsoever with regard to title.
                </p>

                <p>
                    6.3.3. Once transaction details have been submitted to the Tari Network, we cannot assist you to
                    cancel or otherwise modify your transaction or transaction details. Tari Labs has no control over
                    the Tari Network and does not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification
                    requests.
                </p>

                <h3>6.4. Forks</h3>

                <p>
                    In the event of a Fork or other network disruption, Tari Labs may not be able to support activity
                    related to your XTM. In the event of a Fork, the transactions may not be completed, completed
                    partially, incorrectly completed, or substantially delayed. Tari Labs is not responsible for any
                    loss incurred by you caused in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by a Fork or other network
                    disruption.
                </p>

                <h3>6.5. No Password Recovery</h3>

                <p>
                    6.5.1. With respect to the Wallet, Tari Labs does not receive or store a backup of your Wallet
                    credentials, including, without limitation, your Emoji Id, passphrases, identifiers, backup phrases,
                    private keys and network addresses or transaction history. We cannot assist you with Wallet
                    credentials retrieval. You are solely responsible for remembering, storing and keeping secret your
                    Wallet credentials. Any XTM you have associated with such Wallet may become inaccessible if you do
                    not know or keep secret your Wallet credentials. Any third party with knowledge of one or more of
                    your credentials (including, without limitation, a backup phrase, wallet identifier or password) can
                    dispose of XTM in your Wallet.
                </p>

                <p>
                    6.5.2. When you create a Wallet, you must: (a) create a strong password that you do not use for any
                    other website or online service; (b) provide accurate and truthful information; (c) protect and keep
                    secret all credentials for the Wallet; (d) protect access to your device and your Wallet; (e)
                    promptly notify us if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to your
                    Wallet; and (f) use the backup functionality provided through the Wallet and safeguard your backup
                    files. You agree to take responsibility for all activities that occur with your Wallet and accept
                    all risks of any authorized or unauthorized access to your Wallet, to the maximum extent permitted
                    by law.
                </p>

                <h3>6.6. Fees</h3>

                <p>
                    Tari Labs does not currently charge a fee for the Wallet receiving, sending or controlling XTM.
                    However, we reserve the right to do so in the future, and in such case shall display to you any
                    applicable fees prior to you incurring the fee. Network fees (including, without limitation
                    &quot;miner&apos;s fees&quot;) required to use the Tari Network may apply to a transaction. We may
                    attempt to calculate such a fee for you. Our calculation may not be sufficient, or it may be
                    excessive. You may select a greater or lesser fee. You are solely responsible for selecting and
                    paying any such fee and Tari Labs shall neither advance nor fund such a fee on your behalf, nor be
                    responsible for any excess or insufficient fee calculation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    7.1. By using the Tari Testnet and Testnet Wallet you agree to these terms and acknowledge and agree
                    that the Tari Testnet and platform is in development and that use of the Tari Testnet is entirely at
                    your sole risk. You agree to use the Testnet and Testnet Wallet for testing purposes only and
                    understand that Testnet Wallets may be periodically wiped without warning. You further acknowledge
                    and agree that all information and materials published, distributed or otherwise made available on
                    the Tari Testnet are provided for non-commercial, personal use only.
                </p>

                <p>
                    7.2. No party involved in, or having contributed to the development of, the Tari Testnet including
                    any of their affiliates, directors, employees, contractors, service providers or agents (the Parties
                    Involved) accepts any responsibility or liability to you or any third parties in relation to any
                    materials or information accessed or downloaded via the Tari Testnet. You hereby acknowledge and
                    agree that the Parties Involved are not responsible for any damage to your computer systems, loss of
                    data, or any other loss or damage resulting (directly or indirectly) from use of the Tari Testnet.
                </p>

                <p>
                    7.3. To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event shall the Parties Involved have any
                    liability whatsoever to any person for any direct or indirect loss, liability, cost, claim, expense
                    or damage of any kind, whether in contract or in tort, including negligence or otherwise, arising
                    out of or related to the use of all or part of the Tari Testnet.
                </p>

                <p>
                    7.4. The Tari TestNet is not yet 100% complete or stable. The network may be restarted, possibly
                    multiple times, causing all Testnet Wallets to be wiped.
                </p>

                <h2 id="8-txtm">8. tXTM</h2>

                <p>8.1. Your use of the Tari Testnet involves the use of tXTM.</p>

                <h3>8.2. Allocation.</h3>

                <p>
                    Upon your successful creation of a Tari Wallet, you may be allocated an initial amount of tXTM. We
                    may allocate additional tXTM to you at our sole discretion upon your request. We may at any time
                    vary the amount of tXTM to be allocated to you.
                </p>

                <h3>8.3. Limited License.</h3>

                <p>
                    You do not own any tXTM that you may be allocated or that you may otherwise receive. Instead, you
                    receive a limited license to use such tXTM on the Tari Testnet. Tari Labs may terminate your license
                    to use tXTM at any time and for any reason in its sole discretion without notice, refund, or
                    compensation. Tari Labs is not responsible for replacing tXTM or providing you with any credit or
                    refund in the event that your ability to use tXTM is terminated, lost or damaged, or for any other
                    reason. You agree that Tari Labs will have no liability to you based on its exercise of its rights
                    with respect to tXTM.
                </p>

                <h3>8.4. Usage.</h3>

                <p>
                    tXTM may only be used for Tari Testnet system resources. Any tXTM allocated to you must only be used
                    by you and not by any third party. All tXTM can be used solely for the TariTestnet within the Tari
                    Testnet environment and you shall not use any tXTM or the Tari Testnet in any manner that increases
                    your allocation or consumption of tXTM or Tari Testnet resources to the detriment of other users.
                </p>

                <h3>8.5. Temporary in Nature.</h3>

                <p>
                    All tXTM are temporary in nature and can only be used for a limited period of time that is
                    stipulated by us. We also reserve the right to void any tXTM allocated to any user any time as we
                    wish.
                </p>

                <h3>8.6. Value.</h3>

                <p>
                    tXTM has no monetary value and cannot be exchanged for cash, cash equivalent, or other tokens or
                    cryptocurrencies. You shall not attach any value to any tXTM and you are prohibited from using any
                    tXTM for any purposes other than to access and use the Tari Testnet. Without limitation, you must
                    not, and must not permit any person to, trade tXTM with any third party for any purpose, make tXTM
                    available for trade on any cryptocurrency exchange, offer tXTM for rent, lease, sale, or trade in
                    any manner, or attempt to do any of the foregoing. The amount of tXTM received is subject to our
                    sole discretion at all times. tXTM has no monetary value and may not be sold under any
                    circumstances. Neither use of the Tari Testnet nor receipt of any tXTM thereon gives any user any
                    right to receive XTM or anything else in the future (on the Tari Mainnet or otherwise). Your balance
                    of tXTM on the Tari Testnet will not transfer to the Tari Mainnet.
                </p>

                <h3>8.7. Modification.</h3>

                <p>
                    We may from time to time add, modify, or remove any feature, functionality, or usability of any
                    Testnet Token.

                <h3>9.1. Description</h3>

                <p>
                    We may offer you the opportunity to receive XTM at no cost (<strong>Airdrop</strong>), subject to
                    the terms described in this section. The Airdrop Program is provided to you exclusively by Tari
                    Labs. The XTM is delivered by us to you, but is manufactured, offered and supported by the Tari
                    Network, and not by Tari Labs.
                </p>

                <h3>9.2. Terms of Airdrop Program</h3>

                <p>9.2.1. No Purchase Necessary</p>

                <p>
                    There is no purchase necessary to receive XTM in an Airdrop. However, you must have a Wallet.
                    Although Tari Labs does not charge a fee for participation in the Airdrop Program, we reserve the
                    right to do so in the future and shall provide prior notice to you in such case.
                </p>

                <p>9.2.2. Timing</p>

                <p>Each Airdrop shall be subject to any terms displayed in the Services.</p>

                <p>9.2.3. Limited Supply</p>

                <p>
                    An offer to receive XTM in an Airdrop is only available to you while supplies last. Once the amount
                    of XTM offered by Tari Labs in an Airdrop is exhausted, any party who has either been placed on a
                    waitlist, or has completed certain additional steps, but not yet received notice of award of XTM in
                    such Airdrop, shall no longer be eligible to receive XTM in that Airdrop. Tari Labs reserves the
                    right, in our sole discretion, to modify or suspend any Airdrop requirements at any time without
                    notice, including the amount previously advertised as available.
                </p>

                <p>9.2.4. Eligibility</p>

                <p>
                    You may not be eligible to receive XTM from an Airdrop in your jurisdiction. In the event that you
                    have multiple Wallets with Tari Labs, you are only eligible to receive XTM from an Airdrop in one
                    Wallet and for one user.
                </p>

                <p>9.2.5. Notice of Award</p>

                <p>
                    In the event you are selected to receive XTM in an Airdrop, we shall provide you with written notice
                    of the pending delivery of such XTM. Eligibility may be limited as to time. We are not liable to you
                    for failure to receive any notice associated with the Airdrop Program due to change in your contact
                    information that was not updated by you prior to such time as the notice was delivered by us to you.
                </p>

                <h3>9.3. No Obligation</h3>

                <p>
                    Tari Labs has no obligation to provide any XTM in connection with the Airdrop Program, even if
                    participants have accrued a certain amount of rewards. Tari Labs reserves the right to withhold or
                    revoke rewards and/or XTM without consequences.
                </p>

                <h3>9.4. Risk Disclosures Relating to Airdrop Program</h3>

                <p>
                    You are solely responsible for researching and understanding the Tari Network and/or Tari Testnet
                    subject to the Airdrop. You may not rely on any of our statements concerning the foregoing.
                </p>

                <h2 id="10-general-risk-factors">10. GENERAL RISK FACTORS</h2>

                <p>
                    Your use of the Services requires you to bear risks for which we cannot be held responsible. We list
                    some, but not all of these risks below:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        a) Hardware, software or connections required to interact with the Tari Network and/or Tari
                        Testnet might fail, succumb to malware, unauthorized access or malicious attacks. Third parties
                        may obtain unauthorized access to the Services, including, but not limited to your public and
                        private keys. Tari Labs shall not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions,
                        errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Services, however caused.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        b) Forks, unknown vulnerabilities in or unanticipated changes to the network protocol may cause
                        losses to you or others. Tari Labs has no control over the Tari Network and/or Tari Testnet and
                        shall not be responsible for any harm occurring as a result of the inability to reverse a
                        transaction, and any losses in connection therewith due to erroneous or fraudulent actions.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        c) The risk of loss of value in using Services involving XTM and/or tXTM may be substantial and
                        losses may occur over a short period of time. In addition, price and liquidity are subject to
                        significant fluctuations that may be unpredictable.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        d) XTM and tXTM are not legal tender and are not backed by any sovereign government. In
                        addition, the legislative and regulatory landscape around virtual currencies such as XTM and
                        tXTM is constantly changing and may affect your ability to use or transfer XTM and/or tXTM.
                    </li>

                    <li>

                    15. DISPUTE RESOLUTION FOR UNITED STATES USERS
                </h2>

                <h3>15.1. Disputes</h3>

                <p>
                    If you live in the United States (or, if you are a business, have your principal place of business
                    in the United States), any dispute arising between you and us under this User Agreement or our
                    relationship (whether arising out of contract, tort, statute or any other manner) shall be settled
                    in binding arbitration, in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act under the American
                    Arbitration Association&apos;s rules; provided, however, nothing in this Agreement will waive,
                    preclude or otherwise limit your right to (i) bring an individual action in a US small claims court
                    or (ii) file a representative action solely to obtain a public injunction.
                </p>

                <h3>15.2. Arbitration</h3>

                <p>
                    The arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and shall take place in the county
                    or parish of your billing address, or another mutually agreeable location, in the English language.
                    The arbitrator shall apply the law of the state of <strong>Tennessee</strong>, without regard to its
                    conflict of laws principles. The arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent
                    jurisdiction could award, including attorneys&apos; fees when authorized by law, and the arbitration
                    decision may be enforced in any court. You agree that the arbitrator shall have the authority to
                    order relief, and you agree to abide by all decisions and awards rendered in such a proceeding,
                    which shall be final and conclusive. At your request, hearings may be conducted in person or by
                    telephone and the arbitrator may provide for submitting and determining motions on briefs, without
                    oral hearings. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this agreement shall be
                    entitled to reasonable costs and attorneys&apos; fees. If the arbitrator(s) or administrator imposes
                    filing fees or other administrative costs on you, we will reimburse you, upon request, to the extent
                    such fees or costs would exceed those that you would otherwise have to pay if you were proceeding
                    instead in a court. If a court decides that any provision of this section concerning Arbitration is
                    invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be severed and resolved in accordance with{' '}
                    <strong>Tennessee</strong> law exclusively and the other parts of this section concerning
                    Arbitration shall still apply. In no case shall the remainder of this User Agreement be affected. If
                    the invalidity or unenforceability of a provision causes a dispute to proceed in a court instead of
                    arbitration, the Parties agree that such court must be located in{' '}
                    <strong>Nashville, Tennessee</strong>, applying <strong>Tennessee</strong> law.
                </p>

                <h3>15.3. No Trial by Jury</h3>

                <p>
                    By entering into this User Agreement, you expressly waive your right to a trial by jury and right to
                    participate in a class action lawsuit.

                    business outside of the United States), any dispute arising between you and us under this User
                    Agreement or our relationship (whether arising out of contract, tort, statute or any other manner),
                    the courts located in <strong>Nashville, Tennessee</strong> shall have exclusive jurisdiction of
