                    <h3>Self-Custody of Personal and Transaction Data</h3>
                    <p>
                        We offer the Services to enable you to self-custody your Tari and similarly seek for you to
                        self-custody your personal information and transaction history. Accordingly, the information we
                        collect about you is very limited and generally for the purpose of providing and improving the
                        Services we offer to you.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Active Collection of Information</h3>
                    <p>
                        We may collect certain information that you voluntarily provide to us which may contain personal
                        information. For example, if you opt in to receiving communications from Tari Labs via email, we
                        may collect your name and email address. We retain this information until you ask to be
                        unsubscribed from our list(s). If you purchase any products from Tari Labs, we may collect
                        shipping information (such as name and mailing address) from you in order to ship the products
                        to you. We do not sell or otherwise transmit any such actively-collected personal information to
                        third parties other than to third party service providers discussed in Section 4.

                    <h3>Passive Collection of Information</h3>
                    <p>
                        When you use the Services, some information about your visit is automatically collected. This
                        information includes your IP address, access times, browser type and language, and referring web
                        site addresses. We collect this information to troubleshoot technical issues, understand how
                        visitors use the Services, provide an experience relevant to the general location associated
                        with your IP address, and to make improvements to our website.

                        associated with you) in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further
                        notice to you.

                        We employ industry standard security measures designed to protect the security of all
                        information submitted through the Services. However, the security of information transmitted
                        through the internet can never be guaranteed. We are not responsible for any interception or
                        interruption of any communications through the internet or for changes to or losses of data.
                        Users of the Services are responsible for maintaining the security of any user credentials or
                        other form of authentication involved in obtaining access to password protected or secure areas
                        of any of the Services. In order to protect you and your data, we may suspend your use of any of
                        the Services, without notice, pending an investigation, if any breach of security is suspected.

                        Whenever we transfer your personal information out of the EEA to the U.S. or countries not
                        deemed by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of personal information
                        protection, the transfer will be based on a data transfer mechanism recognized by the European
                        Commission as providing adequate protection for personal information.
