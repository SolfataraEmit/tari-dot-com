We're so excited that you want to help make Tari even better. We also realise that blockchain codebases can be pretty
intimidating. This is where this blog comes in.

The articles in this blog are aimed squarely at developers that want to get involved with the project, but don't know
where to start.

The articles here are reasonably technical, and cover different parts of the Tari codebase. There are also executable
sections of code that let you play with the Tari modules without even having to leave your browser.

Click the ▶️ button in the top-right corner of the code snippets and wait for the result.

```
fn main() {
    println!("Damn, that's so cool!");
}
```

The code is completely editable too, so go ahead and try some Rust code out! We've included the top 100 crates as well
as all the Tari crates into the virtual machine so you can run almost[^1] anything you like.

If you mess up, not to worry! The ⟲ icon will put the code the way you found it.

Finally, you can copy your masterpieces to the clipboard with the Copy button.

Happy coding!

[^1]: Almost anything. The code must compile inside a minute, and there are no networking features supported.
