Got a burning question about Tari, but the core devs are too busy to answer you? Well fret no more!

Tari has partnered with [kapa.ai](https://kapa.ai) to bring you the cutting edge in AI-powered chatbot technology. 

Taribot has been trained and re-trained, forced to write and then re-write gruelling exams covering all of Tari's RFC 
documentation, developer update history and the full lyrical history of the band Toto until it was able to recall, with 
stunning accuracy anything to do with Tari. And whether it's seen rains come down in Africa (it has). 

TariBot can't unionise, so we've pumped it to its gills in Redbull and it is waiting, ready and eager to answer 
all your questions, 24/7, 365.

### Where do I find it?

We've integrated Taribot into the [Tari website](https://tari.com).

We've also integrated Taribot into our discord server, on the #ask_taribot channel.

  </video>

We'll be adding resources to Taribot over time, so its knowledge stays current and relevant.

We can't wait for you to give it a try!
