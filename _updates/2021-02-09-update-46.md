## Tari Release v0.8.2

Version 0.8.2 has been released. This release was mainly to fix a bug in the target block time that was set too low in the Stibbons Testnet, which
resulted in a short network split.

### Wallet Notify in Console wallet

The ability to run some code whenever a wallet receives or sends a transactions, commonly referred to as "Wallet Notify", after the config setting in `bitcoind`,
allows for some very simple integrations. This function is now available in the Tari Console Wallet. For example, you could write a script that sends an email or posts to your favorite chat app whenever your wallet receives, sends or completes a transaction.
