Version 0.7.2 brings a number of major changes. Most notably block sync speed has been increased dramatically with the merging of [#2436](https://github.com/tari-project/tari/pull/2436) for SHA3 blocks and [#2483](https://github.com/tari-project/tari/pull/2483) for RandomX blocks. The blockchain database structure
has changed, so you'll need to delete your `db` folder and sync from scratch.

Nodes are now downloading seeds via DNS at `seeds.ridcully.tari.com`.

A standalone SHA3 miner was also [merged](https://github.com/tari-project/tari/pull/2513), fixing a lot of the bugs in the miner included in the base node. In the near future the wallet and miner in the base node will be removed entirely.

## Some other major changes:

- [#2477](https://github.com/tari-project/tari/pull/2477) Integrate Rewindable outputs into Transactions.
  This is a precursor to wallet recovery. By storing information in the bullet proof, a wallet will be able scan the blockchain to find UTXOs that belong to it.
- [#2496](https://github.com/tari-project/tari/pull/2496) Remove Pending and Orphan pool from Mempool. These extra pools were open to abuse and only catered
  for advanced scenarios, which were not yet implemented. At a later stage they may be added back, but for now the community decided to remove them to simplify
  development and testing.
- [#2494](https://github.com/tari-project/tari/pull/2494) Add console wallet passphrase encryption.
