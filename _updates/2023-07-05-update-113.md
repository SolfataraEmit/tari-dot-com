The paper, titled _TariScript: Bringing dynamic scripting to Mimblewimble_, went through a full peer-review process 
and will be published in the conference proceedings. For those who don't wish to wait, you can 
[download the preprint now](/assets/updates/docs/tariscript.pdf).

The acceptance and publication of the paper is acknowledgement 
by the broader crypto community that Tari is making significant original contributions to the space. 

If you find the paper a little dense, [RFC-201](https://rfc.tari.com/RFC-0201_TariScript.html) is an 
approachable alternative, while going into considerably greater detail than the paper's 10-page limit allows.

If this is still over your head, then perhaps our 
[ECC primer on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69bl6dfM6jI) is
the introduction you are looking for.
