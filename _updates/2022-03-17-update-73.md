### Tari v0.30.0 Released

A new version of the Tari applications has been released. The release notes are provided at the end of this post, but the most exciting 
changes are related to the hard fork test.


### Testnet Hard Fork at 23000

We'll be testing a hard fork on Dibbler testnet at block 23000. That's likely to happen in the next 2 to 3 days, and you'll want to make sure you are running version 0.30.0 or higher of your 
base node before then. With the previous network breaking changes, it was easier and more efficient 
to reset the network, but now that the code is more stable, it's time to test an actual hard fork as it would happen in a mainnet.

#### What is a hard fork?
Blocks and transactions are versioned as their structure changes, for example, when new features are added. Nodes running the newer code will understand new versions and see them as valid, whereas nodes running older software will reject them. In this case, there will be a split in the network. If the majority of nodes are running the new code, the hard fork will succeed. If not, the older code will be the stronger chain, and the hard fork will be rejected. 
In a mainnet scenario, there is usually more notice given before a hard fork, but for Tari's testnet, we may want to run a few of these tests.
