title: Final proof-of-work proposal open for comment

It's nearly there! After
[two](/2019/10/14/tari-protocol-discussion-47.html)
[rounds](/2020/06/12/tari-protocol-discussion-52.html) of intense community discussion, the final proposal for the Tari
proof-of-work strategy has been released as an [RFC].

This means that the proposal is open for comment, and is thus subject to change, but short of any compelling arguments
to the contrary, it's very likely that Tari's proof of work will be implemented as described in the RFC.

In summary, the RFC proposes the following:

Tari will employ a hybrid mining approach. It will comprise two mining algorithms, with an average combined target block
time of 120 s, to match Monero's block interval.

The first algorithm is CPU-friendly: Monero merged-mining using RandomX. On average, 60% of blocks will be mined using
RandomX.

The second algorithm is a Tari-only, independent, "GPU-friendly" SHA-3-based proof-of-work algorithm. An
average of 40% of Tari blocks will be found using this algorithm.

The [RFC] has more details on how and why these algorithms were selected.
