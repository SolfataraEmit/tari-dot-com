🎉🎉🎉 Tari Base Node v0.4.2 is
[available for download now](https://tari.com/downloads) 🍾🍾🍾

This release has some **breaking peer-to-peer changes**, so you are strongly encouraged to **upgrade as soon as
possible** so that your node's performance stays in tip-top shape.

Older nodes (from v0.2.4 and up) will still synchronise the block chain, but they won't understand the new block
propagation improvements and so will always be lagging behind their peers.

Now let's lift the hood and peer at some of the highlights:

## Block propagation improvements

As of v0.4.2 nodes propagate a block hash (33 bytes) instead of the full block. This will significantly reduce network
bandwidth usage for block propagation (For math nerds, full block messages drop from 𝒪(n²) to 𝒪(n)). If every node is
propagating to 10 peers on average, that's roughly a 90% bandwidth reduction.

On receipt of a block hash a node checks if it has the block. If so, it simply ignores the message. Otherwise, it
requests the full block from the peer that sent the hash.

## Resolve peer DNS addresses with Tor if it is available

This is a privacy enhancing change that applies to nodes running in TCP mode with Tor support. Previously, connecting to
a peer's DNS address would use the system's DNS resolution and that can be exploited to de-anonymise users.

## New emoji set support 😀👍🏽🤣!

v0.4.2 brings the new emoji set into the base node CLI. This will resolve any issues you have copying and pasting emoji
ids from Aurora v0.2.0 and up into the node CLI.

There's more detail on the emoji set changes in
[a previous dev update](https://www.tari.com/updates/2020-06-10-update-23.html).

## gRPC support for base nodes

The base nodes now support gRPC. This will allow us to decouple the wallet and base node executables. To see the gRPC
interface in action, you can peruse the
[Block Explorer Source Code](https://github.com/tari-project/blockchain-explorer-api), which makes heavy use of gRPC.

## Initial Mempool sync

On startup, a node will now try and sync its mempool with a peer. Previously, mempools only filled up organically via
transaction propagation. This is fine for most nodes, but if you're a miner, you really want to know about existing
transactions when you start up so that you can mine full blocks.

## `get-block` now has a format specifier

`get-block` adds a format specifier which allows the user to print blocks in text or json format. The latter is useful
in testing.

### Example:

`>> get-block 1 text  // OR get-block 1`
