After the Ridcully testnet reset, the community has been able to find and fix some critical bugs. Release v0.6.1 brings
a number of fixes including an important fix to the process of recovering from an unsuccessful reorg. This should make the
network more stable and prevent network segregation due to banning.

The community has also implemented a number of fixes and features in the console wallet, including showing the balance and custom fees.

Distributing seed peers via DNS is included in this release, but there are no official DNS seeds yet. If you'd like to test it out on your own DNS, the format is specified [here](https://github.com/tari-project/tari/pull/2319).
