We’ve got a lot to share with you this update, with new features and improvements across Tari’s projects. Let’s start with what has been a core focus for us over the past two months - the release of Tari Universe.

We recently launched, [Tari Universe](https://universe.tari.com/), a desktop mining app that provides an easy, elegant way to mine Tari with 1-click. The aim is to simplify the setup of Tari mining and provide a user-friendly interface that clearly communicates essential information and makes it easy to configure the miner to the user’s preferences. We consider this key to make Tari more approachable to a broader audience.

We’ve limited access to the app to test it out in a controlled manner and get relevant feedback at each stage. If you’re interested in participating, you can join the waiting list for early access on the [Tari Universe launch site](https://universe.tari.com/) or by finding and existing user and getting their invite link. By joining us on this journey, you'll have the opportunity to earn airdrop gems. The more you mine, and friends you invite, the more gems you’ll earn. For more information on other ways to earn gems, turtle shells and sky hammers, please visit the [Tari Airdrop Game website](https://airdrop.tari.com/).

We’d like to thank the community - veterans and newcomers alike - currently exploring the Universe and providing valuable suggestions and feedback. Thanks to your support, we’ve added some great useability features, improved the overall user experience, and learned valuable lessons for future mainnet deployment.

### Providing More Languages for Tari Universe

If you're keen to get involved, we'd love you to expand Tari Universe's supported languages. Tari Universe handles this through JSON localization files, which make it easy for anyone to review or add new localizations to the project. We've put together a guide for those interested in getting involved in this area of Tari's development, [which you'll find here](/lessons/07_add_new_localizations).

## Minotari - Base Layer

### P2Pool Progress

The incorporation of P2Pool support into Minotari continues to progress. Since our [last update](https://tari.com/updates/2024-07-22-update-133), we’ve added support for merge mining, randomX proof of work algo usage, custom coinbase data to block requests, and more. There is more work to do on the P2Pool front and our goal is to release a major update next week.

### Wallet Improvements

The ability to [encrypt your seed words](https://github.com/tari-project/tari/pull/6569), [additional resilience for network reliability](https://github.com/tari-project/tari/pull/6527), and new features to the console wallet like [generating a paper wallet and additional fields to the informational tabs](https://github.com/tari-project/tari/pull/6531) round out crucial work done on Minotari's reliability and security.

## The Ootle - Tari’s Layer 2

### Concentrating on Consensus

Fixes and fine-tuning have been the focus of development for the Ootle’s consensus mechanisms for the past two months. Some notable fixes include (but are certainly not limited to):

- Many improvements to the transaction creation process, the inclusion of evidence data, reduced validator node setup time, and additional fixes ([PR 1141](https://github.com/tari-project/tari-dan/pull/1141))
- A fix of substate pledges in multi-shard implementations ([PR 1119](https://github.com/tari-project/tari-dan/pull/1119))
- Deference of proposed transactions with conflicting input versions for multi-shard environments ([PR 1125](https://github.com/tari-project/tari-dan/pull/1125))
- Improvements around evidence data, including optimization and security improvements such as the inclusion of a unique QC ID for auditing purposes. ([PR 1141](https://github.com/tari-project/tari-dan/pull/1141), [PR 1130](https://github.com/tari-project/tari-dan/pull/1130))
