## Tari Base Node v0.5.6 released with hard fork changes

Release v0.5.6 comes with a number of improvements to the distributed hash table (DHT) network and block propagation
strategy. These aim to solve the problem of nodes getting isolated from the network.

This version also has some consensus rule changes that some into effect on block 120,000. This should be mined some
time on Sunday 18th October. These changes will fork the chain, so we encourage all testnet node operators and miners
to upgrade to v0.5.6 as soon as possible. The rule changes fix, among others, an issue on the monero block difficulty calculation
and switching the emission curve to pure integer-based math.

### Major features since v0.5.5

- Propagate block hashes to all connected nodes [PR](https://github.com/tari-project/tari/pull/2232)
