## Code audits

On behalf of the Tari community, we are happy to announce that [Coinspect](https://www.coinspect.com/) will be
conducting an audit of the Tari base node (Minotari) code and wallet library. Coinspect is a well-known name in the
crypto security space and has experience in auditing Mimblewimble-based protocols, having completed
the [Grin audit](https://www.coinspect.com/grin-security-audit/) in 2019.

The Tari community has been diligently tidying up the codebase, sprucing up documentation and completing its own set of
reviews in preparation for the external audit. This work is complete and the base node code was frozen for the audit on
30 June.

Commit [`87c0703059511`](https://github.com/tari-project/tari/releases/tag/v0.51.0-pre.4) is the reference commit for
the audit.

The audit kicked off this week, the first week of July, and should run for around three months.

The Tari base layer codebase comprises around [250,000 lines of source code](https://github.com/tari-project/tari). This
represents an enormous amount of development work. It is not possible, from a time nor cost perspective to have the
entire quarter of a million lines of code be subject to a detailed audit.

Therefore, we have selected the most critical parts of the codebase — those parts where bugs could lead to users losing
money — to be subject to detailed scrutiny. This represents around 40% of the total code base.

These critical components include the consensus code, the wallet transactional protocol, and the P2P overlay network.
Coinspect will be focusing on these aspects of the codebase. The crypto library, including the bulletproof+
implementation, will be reviewed by third parties with a specialisation in cryptography, including QuarksLabs.

Together, this represents a reasonably thorough coverage of the Tari codebase. Of course, no amount of review and
auditing guarantees that a codebase is bug-free. The intent is to demonstrate that the Tari community has taken all
practical steps to produce a codebase that is secure and reliable, even in the absence of any guarantees.

Let’s see what the next three months bring. We are quietly hopeful that the audit proceeds well.
